#Individual machines; each one has a 'group' with its short non-FQDN name where it's the only member:

[server1]
server1.wackadoodle.com

[server2]
server2.wackadoodle.com

[server3]
server3.wackadoodle.com

[server4]
server4.wackadoodle.com

#This is a group with all of the servers in it:

[servers]
server1.wackadoodle.com
server2.wackadoodle.com
server3.wackadoodle.com
server4.wackadoodle.com

# Same idea with these groups (you can group machines however you like):
[ubuntu]
server1.wackadoodle.com
server2.wackadoodle.com
server3.wackadoodle.com
server4.wackadoodle.com

[docker_servers]
server1.wackadoodle.com
server2.wackadoodle.com
server3.wackadoodle.com
server4.wackadoodle.com
